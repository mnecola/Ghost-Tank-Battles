Ghost Tank Battles is a 2 player competition game. player 1 uses the arrow keys and player 2 uses W,A,S,D. Every time you relaod the game it is 100% garenteed to be a new map allowing new ideas and angles for the shots. The graphics are minimalistic and simple to adapt to but the stratigies are up to you! The "Ghost" part in this game is the fact that your tank can go through walls for an escape or a open shot. creating more stratigies for each player. When you shoot your bullet you can see which one is yours by the color of the bullet that matches your tank. Upon impact with the other player or a wall the bullet with explode and destroy the other tank ending the game!
